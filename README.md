Lung250M-4B: A Combined 3D Dataset for CT- and Point Cloud-Based Intra-Patient Lung Registration

This repository accompanies the NeurIPS dataset submission Lung250M-4B. To access and download the dataset itself please visit https://cloud.imi.uni-luebeck.de/s/s64fqbPpXNexBPP. The preprint (under review) of the paper and its supplementary material are available as PDFs as well.   

The code repository comprises several complementary parts:
1) Scripts and manifest files to download and preprocess raw Dicom image files from TCIA or Nifti files from the the original data sources. While this step is optional for all subsets that are shared with CC-BY licence, it is necessary for the COPDgene dataset and EMPIRE10. The pre-processing pipeline might also help researchers to extend the dataset with other sources.
2)
